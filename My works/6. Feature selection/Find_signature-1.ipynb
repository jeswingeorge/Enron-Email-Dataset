    "# Feature Selection Mini-Project - Find signature\n",
    "\n",
    "Katie explained in a video a problem that arose in preparing Chris and Sara’s email for the author identification project; it had to do with a feature that was a little too powerful (effectively acting like a signature, which gives an arguably unfair advantage to an algorithm). You’ll work through that discovery process here.\n",

    "This bug was found when Katie was trying to make an overfit decision tree to use as an example in the decision tree mini-project. A decision tree is classically an algorithm that can be easy to overfit; one of the easiest ways to get an overfit decision tree is to use a small training set and lots of features.  \n",
